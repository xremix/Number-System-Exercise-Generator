# Number System Exercise Generator
This project is intended for students to practices exercies with number systems.
This site will generate exercise for you - as well as their solutions.

*The website is completly in German right now.*

## Exercise Website
### [This Website](https://rawgit.com/xremix/Number-System-Exercise-Generator/master/number-system-exercises.html) will generate the following exercies:

##### 1) Convert Decimal to binary - or reverse (2b is comma based)
Number between `1 and 100`, can also be negative. 2b can be comma seperated.
Order from decimal to bin or reverse is random as well.

##### 2) Convert Number of a base to another base
Source base is between `2-16` and the target base any of `2, 4, 8, 10 or 16`
The number is between `20 and 200`.

##### 3a) Convert Dezimal to twos complement - or reverse
Convert a number into the twos complement (or reverse). The number can be negative or positive. There is one question for `8 bit`, another one for `16 bit`.

##### 4) Convert decimal to IEEE 754 - or reverse
The number will be between `1 and 100`, can be negative and comma seperated. 
Order in which way need to be converted is randomized.

## Exercise C Tool
The `C` Tool generates the following exercies:
- Convert number with base to another base (no solution yet, better use the website for that)
- Convert decimal number to binary number of two's complement
- Convert decimal number to binary number
- Convert decimal number to number of standard IEEE 754
